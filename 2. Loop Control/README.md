# Loop Control
There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages âˆ’

Java programming language provides the following types of loop to handle looping requirements.
* <b>while loop</b> - Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body. See the <b>WhileLoop.java</b> example.
* <b>for loop</b> - Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
* <b>do...while loop</b> - Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body. See <b>DoWhileLoop.java</b>
* <b>Enhanced for loop</b> - This is mainly used to traverse collection of elements including arrays. See <b>EnhancedForLoop.java</b> example
